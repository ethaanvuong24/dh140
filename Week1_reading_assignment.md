## [Using Accelerated Data Analytics to Set U.S. Vaccination Priorities](https://tdwi.org/articles/2021/01/08/adv-all-accelerated-data-analytics-to-set-us-vaccination-priorities.aspx) 

###### Summary of the article
During the COVID-19 pandemic, data has played a large role in disseminating information to the general public as well as creating policy and vaccines. As the public health crisis ensued, the need for immediate data became more in demand. It is crucial for accurate data to constantly be reported and updated in order to create the most accurate and effective vaccines and policy for the general public. The article details the importance of spatiotemporal data analysis (the study of data collected for both geography and time) as there are many changes and updates that occur rapidly. Within the field of data science, there is great importance placed on speed and scale of data that is collected and analyzed. Scientists have taken advantage of the latest technologies to stay updated with the most accurate data at any given moment.

###### Reflection
This article was very insightful in demonstrating the need for immediate and accurate data at all times. Not only does updated data help to develop the most beneficial and efficent technology, but also older data may prove to be innaccurate and act as a detriment to whatever field it is in. This truly highlighted the importance of time when researching or looking into other data sets. The time that the data was recorded may play a large role in the accuracy of the data, which then affects the outcome of the research. This also demonstrates how quickly the field of data science can change with the development of new technology that continues to emerge, and inspires me to always strive to learn. Even if someone has mastered data science, there may be some changes the next day. Thus, that 'master' must continue to learn and hone their skills to remain one.
