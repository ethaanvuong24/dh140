### Reaction to "Rachel Levine on using Open Street Maps for humanitarian causes"

My original thought regarding Open Street Map is that it is very biased to communities with large access to technology. There is this disparity between predominantly white countries that share their stories and data, in comparison to the lack of data seen in other, non-white, countries. Maps in general are created in areas that will provide profit, so I appreciate how Open Street Map is an open source project that works with volunteers to mitigate these disparities in maps that lack detail. I think humanitarian causes truly depend on open data because there may not be the resources to pay for accurate data. Open data seems to be a great resource for various causes especially in regard to communicating to all members of the community. Open street data is also helpful for the various causes because they are data validators that ensure that the inputted data is updated since everything is bound to change. With the emergence of the COVID-19 Pandemic, there have been many changes to ownership of land and stores as well as business models adjusting to a more socially distanced lifestyle. With these changes, Open street data must be updated just as rapidly, and I believe that with the interconnectedness with people of this era, due to technology, it would be easier to contribute to the maintenance of the information. With more data, we will also be able to uplift the voices of those who are less privileged and bring awareness to more social issues.
