# Week 7 Reading Assignment
A quote that stood out to me while reading this text was "digital humanities expands both the notion of scholarship and the public sphere in order to create new sites and notes of engagement, documentation, and collaboration." I believe that this truly encapsulates how widespread digital humanities can reach and grow as anacademic discipline and field. It is not just something that exists in the academic world but also studies and implements daily functions for the general public. Therefore, everyone is constantly contributing the development of digital humanities just as everyone is comtibuting to history in one way or another. Through psoing questions and challenging existing forms of thought, people continue to expand on and spread new knowledge to all corners of the earth. For example, with technology and things like social media, we are able to communicate with people from various locations and countires. This gives everyone the opportunity to share their stories and uplift their voices that may have been silenced by years of disconnect from the modern world and tragic power imbalances in governments. This is exemplified with the HyperCities where people created a mashup for live streaming and archiving Tweitter feeds from Egypt and visualizing them on a Google Map. Through technology like twitter, even protests in Iran were introduced and publicized to the media. Tools like the #iranelection help to quickly disseminate information all over the world. This demonstrates the power of digital humanities and its effect on the world.
