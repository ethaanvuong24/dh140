## Hi! Im Ethan.
###### I am currently a Senior at UCLA majoring in Biology and minoring in Digital Humanities. I am a beginner to coding, so I am eager to learn in this class.

## Course Description
Welcome to the world of coding and spatial thinking in the digital humanities. In recent years, our relationship with digital data and spatial visualization has changed dramatically. No longer are we limited to a mode of map-making that is dominated by industry giants like Google and ESRI. Instead, a suite of data-science tools have matured to a point where they allow us to produce similar, if not, more powerful and creative ways that advance digital data exploration.

Our understanding of social phenomena through digital and spatial constructs in urban data allow us to address questions on social justice, the environment, transportation, urban histories, community development and design, amongst many other themes, and how these factors may affect different population groups in different ways. This course prepares you for challenges in urban data beyond off-the-shelf cartographic approaches. It looks at the various components of data's journey—acquisition, exploration, modeling, and communication through visualization—and how it enables and advances your research from a coding and data science perspective.

The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of coding and data science. Where once there was a dearth of available digital information, we now live in a world of too much data. How can these data be transformed to human expressions and narratives that are utilized in the humanities? We begin with an introduction to various data science tools, and review the basics of programming with Python. Once a foundation of Python programming and data wrangling is achieved, data analysis through Python Libraries, and subsequently, through advanced spatial analysis will be introduced. All lessons will be based on “real” data with analytical methods addressing relevant and contemporary urban problems. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize digital data for humanistic practices and research.

While there are no prerequisites for taking this course, people who are approaching programming for the first time will admittedly find the course to be intense and challenging.

## Project Ideas
I would love to work on a project that works to research food insecurity or mental health as people have been affected by COVID-19 globally. Researching at the scope of the United States as a whole would show the role that the actions of the United States government has had over the past year. 

Some other Data Science projects that I would find interesting would be analyzing the impact and role that different groups of minorities have in American Culture. This is a broad topic that can be broken down into various aspects of human culture like food, entertainment, education, politics, and so much more.

## Class Objectives
At the end of this course, I hope to be confident in my coding abilities and eager to continue developing my skills

I will learn to:
* Demonstrate the value of data for humanistic inquiry through discovery, exploration, and analysis
* Critically evaluate data and create frameworks to prepare data for research
* Apply data science programming techniques to produce relevant visualizations that inform humanistic research
* Learn to visualize data geo-temporally to communicate the importance of place-based and time-based informatics
* Learn to produce publication-ready scholarly materials in the form of tables, charts, and maps
